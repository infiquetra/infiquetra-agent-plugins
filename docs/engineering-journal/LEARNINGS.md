### Portable plugin standards do not replace vendor runtimes

**Author.** Jeff Cox and Codex

**Context.** Research compared the plugin and skill surfaces used by the coding
agent clients in the Infiquetra environment.

**Evidence.** The
[cross-vendor plugin architecture brief](../cross-vendor-plugin-architecture-brief.md)
links the Agent Skills and Agent Plugins specifications and records the client
compatibility findings.

**Mechanism.** Agent Skills can carry procedural instructions, and Agent
Plugins can package skills with Model Context Protocol servers. Commands,
hooks, native agent definitions, permissions, user interfaces, and marketplace
distribution remain client-specific.

**Generalizable rule.** Keep the shared behavioral contract portable, but use
explicit adapters for capabilities governed by a vendor runtime. Do not call an
installed or copied vendor package the shared source of truth.
